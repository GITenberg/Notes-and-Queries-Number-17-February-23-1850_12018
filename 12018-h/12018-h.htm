    <h3>KING ALFRED'S GEOGRAPHY OF EUROPE.</h3>

    <p>The sketch of Europe, which our illustrious Alfred has
    inserted in his translation of <i>Orosius</i>, is justly
    considered, both here and on the Continent, as a valuable
    fragment of antiquity<a id="footnotetag1"
       name="footnotetag1"></a><a href="#footnote1"><sup>1</sup></a>;
       and I am sorry that I can commend little more than the pains
       taken by his translators, the celebrated Daines Barrington
       and Dr. Ingram, to make it available to ordinary readers.
       The learned judge had very good intentions, but his
       knowledge of Anglo-Saxon was not equal to the task. Dr.
       Ingram professedly applied himself to correct both Alfred's
       text and Barrington's version, so far as relates to the
       description of Europe; but in two instances, occurring in
       one passage, he has adopted the judge's mistake of proper
       names for common nouns. I do not call attention to the
       circumstance merely as a literary curiosity, but to preserve
       the royal geographer from liability to imputations of
       extraordinary ignorance of his subject, and also to show the
       accuracy of his delineation of Europe at that interesting
       epoch, whence the principal states of Europe must date their
       establishment.</p>

    <p>King Alfred, mentioning the seat of the Obotriti, or
    Obotrit&aelig;, as they are sometimes named, a Venedic nation,
    who, in the 9th century, occupied what is now the duchy of
    Mecklenburg, calls them <i>Apdrede</i>, and says&mdash;"Be nor
    than him is apdrede, and cast north wylte the man &aelig;feldan
    h&aelig;t."<a id="footnotetag2"
       name="footnotetag2"></a><a href="#footnote2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

    <p>Barrington translates the words thus:&mdash;"To the north is
    Aprede, and to the north east the wolds which are called
    &AElig;feldan."<a id="footnotetag3"
       name="footnotetag3"></a><a href="#footnote3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

    <p>Dr. Ingram has the following variation:&mdash;"And to the
    east north are the wolds which are called Heath
    Wolds."<a id="footnotetag4"
       name="footnotetag4"></a><a href="#footnote4"><sup>4</sup></a>
       To the word <i>wolds</i> he appends a
       note:&mdash;"<i>Wylte</i>. See on this word a note
       hereafter." Very well; the promised note is to justify the
       metamorphosis of the warlike tribe, known in the annals and
       chronicles of the 9th century as the Wilti, Wilzi, Weleti,
       and Welatibi, into heaths and wolds. Thirty pages further on
       there is a note by J. Reinhold Forster, the naturalist and
       navigator, who wrote it for Barrington in full confidence
       that the translation was correct:&mdash;"The &AElig;feldan,"
       he says, "are, as king Alfred calls them, <i>wolds</i>;
       there are at present in the middle part of Jutland, large
       tracts of high moors, covered with <i>heath</i> only."</p>

    <p>Of <i>wylte</i>, Dr. Ingram writes:&mdash;"This word has
    never been correctly explained; its original signification is
    the same, whether written felds, fields, velts, welds, wilds,
    wylte, wealds, walds, walz, wolds, &amp;c. &amp;c." And on
    <i>heath</i>, he says:&mdash;"Mr. Forster seems to have read
    H&aelig;feldan (or H&aelig;thfeldan), which indeed, I find in
    the Junian MS. inserted as a various reading by Dr. Marshall
    (<i>MSS. Jun. 15</i>.). It also occurs, further on in the MS.,
    without any various reading. I have therefore inserted it in
    the text."</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page258"
       id="page258"></a>{258}</span>

    <p>Dr. Marshall seems to have understood the passage. What King
    Alfred says and means is this:&mdash;"On the north are the
    Apdrede (Obotrit&aelig;), and on the north east of them are the
    Wylte, who are called H&aelig;feldi."</p>

    <p>The anonymous Saxon Poet, who wrote the life of Charlemagne,
    gives the same situation as Alfred to the Wilti:&mdash;</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"Gens est Slavorum Wilti cognomine dicta,</p>

            <p>Proxima litoribus qu&aelig; possidet arva
            supremis</p>

            <p>Jungit ubi oceano proprios Germania
            fines."<a id="footnotetag5"
               name="footnotetag5"></a><a href="#footnote5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>Helmold says that they inhabited the part of the coast
    opposite to the island of Rugen; and hereabouts Adam of Bremen
    places the <i>Heveldi</i>, and many other Slavonic
    tribes.<a id="footnotetag6"
       name="footnotetag6"></a><a href="#footnote6"><sup>6</sup></a>
       I am not aware that any other author than Alfred says, that
       the Wilti and Heveldi were the same people; but the fact is
       probable. The Heveldi are of rare occurrence, but not so the
       Wilti.<a id="footnotetag7"
       name="footnotetag7"></a><a href="#footnote7"><sup>7</sup></a>
       Ptolemy calls them
       &Beta;&epsilon;&lambda;&tau;&alpha;&iota;&mdash;Velt&aelig;
       or Welt&aelig;&mdash;and places them in Prussian Pomerania,
       between the Vistula and Niemen. Eginhard says that "they are
       Slavonians who, in our manner, are called Wilsi, but in
       their own language, Welatibi."<a id="footnotetag8"
       name="footnotetag8"></a><a href="#footnote8"><sup>8</sup></a>
       Their country was called Wilcia,<a id="footnotetag9"
       name="footnotetag9"></a><a href="#footnote9"><sup>9</sup></a>
       and, as a branch of them were settled in Batavia about 560,
       it does not seem very improbable that from them were derived
       the Wils&aelig;ton of the Anglo-Saxon chronicles, meaning
       the <i>Wilts seated</i>, or settlers in Wilts-shire. The
       name, as Eginhard has noticed, is Slavic, and is an adoption
       of <i>welot</i> or <i>weolot</i>, a giant, to denote the
       strength and fierceness which rendered them formidable
       neighbours. <i>Heveldi</i> seems to be the same word made
       emphatic with a foreign addition.</p>

    <p>Two other names have been given much trouble to the
    translators, as well as to Mr. Forster. These are,
    <i>M&aelig;gtha Land</i> and <i>Horiti</i> or <i>Horithi</i>,
    for both occur, and the latter is not written with the letter
    <i>thorn</i>, but with a distinct <i>t</i> and <i>h</i>. Alfred
    has, unquestionably, met with the Slavic <i>gorod</i>, which so
    frequesntly occurs as the termination of the names of cities in
    the region where he indicates the seat of his Horiti to be. It
    signifies a city, and is an etymological equivalent of Goth.
    <i>gards</i>, a house, Lat. <i>cors, cortis</i>; O.N.
    <i>gardr</i>, a district, A.-Sax. <i>geard</i>, whence our
    <i>yard</i>. The Polish form is <i>grodz</i>, and the Sorabic,
    <i>hrodz</i>. He places the Horiti to the east of the Slavi
    Dalamanti, who occupied the district north east of Moravia,
    with the <i>Surpe</i>, that is, Serbi, Servi, on their north,
    and the <i>Sisle</i>, Slusli, another Slavonic people, on the
    west. This appears to be the site possessed by the Hunnic
    founders of Kiow. In Helmold, Chunigord, <i>the city or station
    of the Huns</i>, is the name of the part of Russia containing
    Kiow.<a id="footnotetag10"
       name="footnotetag10"></a><a href="#footnote10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>

    <p>To the north of Horiti, says Alfred, is <i>M&aelig;gtha
    Land</i>.&mdash;A Finnic tribe, called Magyar, were settled in
    the 9th century in Mazovia, whence a part of them descended
    into Hungary. According to Mr. Forster, Mazovia has been called
    <i>Magan Land</i>; but I can find no trace of that name. I can
    easily conceive, however, that <i>Magyar</i> and <i>Land</i>
    might become, in Saxon copying, M&aelig;gtha Land, for the
    country of the Magyar. Elsewhere, Alfred uses M&aelig;gtha
    Land, the land of the Medes, for Persia.</p>

    <p>Is there any other printed copy of the Saxon <i>Orosius</i>
    than Barrington's? for that forbids confidence by a number of
    needless and unauthorised alterations in most of the pages.</p>

    <h3>FOLK LORE.</h3>

    <p><i>Omens from Cattle</i>.&mdash;I forward to you a
    <i>Note</i>, which, many years ago, I inserted in my
    interleaved Brand's <i>Observations on Popular Antiquities</i>,
    vol. ii. p. 519. 4to., in the hope that, as the subject
    interested me <i>then</i>, it may not prove uninteresting to
    some <i>now</i>:&mdash;</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>"A bad omen seems to be drawn from <i>an ox or cow
        breaking into a garden</i>. Though I laugh at the
        superstition, the omen was painfully fulfilled in my
        case.</p>

        <p>"About the middle of March, 1843, some cattle were
        driven close to my house; and, the back door being open,
        <i>three</i> got into our little bit of garden, and
        trampled it. When our school-drudge came in the afternoon,
        and asked the cause of the confusion, she expressed great
        sorrow and apprehension on being told&mdash;said it was a
        bad sign&mdash;and that we should hear of <i>three</i>
        deaths within the next six months. Alas! in April, we heard
        of dear J&mdash;&mdash;'s murder; a fortnight after,
        A&mdash;&mdash; died; and to-morrow, August 10th, I am to
        attend the funeral of my excellent son-in-law.</p>

        <p>"I have just heard of the same omen from another
        quarter."</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>This was added the next day:&mdash;</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>"But what is still more remarkable is, that when I went

    <p><i>The Horse's Head&mdash;Rush-bearings.</i>&mdash;The
    account of the Welch custom of the "Grey Mare" in a late Number
    reminded me of something very similar in Cheshire. In the
    parish of Lynn it is customary, for a week or ten days before
    the 5th <span class="pagenum"><a name="page259"
       id="page259"></a>{259}</span> of November, for the skeleton
       of a horse's head, dressed up with ribbons, &amp;c., having
       glass eyes inserted in the sockets, and mounted on a short
       pole by way of handle, to be carried by a man underneath,
       covered with a horse-cloth. There is generally a chain
       attached to the nose, which is held by a second man, and
       they are attended by several others. In houses to which they
       can gain access, they go through some kind of performance,
       the man with the chain telling the horse to rear, open its
       mouth, &amp;c. Their object, of course, is to obtain money.
       The horse will sometimes seize persons, and hold them fast
       till they pay for being set free; but he is generally very
       peaceable,&mdash;for in case of resistance being offered,
       his companions frequently take flight, and leave the poor
       horse to fight it out. I could never learn the origin of
       this strange custom. I remember, when very young, having a
       perfect horror of meeting this animal in the dark.</p>

    <p>Another custom, which I suppose prevails in some other
    places, is the "Rush-bearing." At the annual Wakes a large
    quantity of rushes are collected together, and loaded on a
    cart, almost to the height of a load of hay. They are bound on
    the cart, and cut evenly at each end. On the Saturday evening a
    number of men sit on the top of the rushes, holding garlands of
    artificial flowers, tinsel, &amp;c. The cart is drawn round the
    parish by three or four spirited horses, decked out with
    ribbons,&mdash;the collars being surrounded with small bells.
    It is attended by morris-dancers, dressed in strange
    style,&mdash;men in women's clothes, &amp;c. One big man in
    woman's clothes, with his face blacked, has a belt round his
    waist, to which is attached a large bell, and carries a ladle,
    in which he collects money from the spectators. The company
    stop and dance at the principal public-houses in their route,
    and then proceed to the parish church(!), where the rushes are
    deposited, and the garlands hung up very conspicuously, to
    remain till the next year. I believe a custom somewhat similar
    exists in the adjoining parish of Warburton, but not carried
    out in such grand style.</p>

    <p>It would be very interesting if your correspondents in
    different parts of the country would send accounts of these
    relics of the barbarous ages.</p>

    <h3>ON AUTHORS AND BOOKS, NO. 5.</h3>

    <p>As a writer of dedications, Samuel Johnson was the giant of
    his time. He once said to Boswell, the subject arising at a
    dinner-party, "Why, I have dedicated to the royal family all
    round,"&mdash;and the <i>honest chronicler</i> proves that he
    spoke advisedly.</p>

    <p>Compositions of this nature admit much variety of character.
    A dedication may be the pure homage which we owe to merit, or
    the expression of gratitude for favours received, or a memorial
    of cherished friendship; and such dedications, in point of
    motive, are beyond the reach of censure&mdash;I may fairly
    assert, are very commendable. Nevertheless, Johnson left no
    compositions of either class: "the <i>loftiness</i> of his
    mind," as Boswell gravely states, "prevented him from ever
    dedicating in his own person."</p>

    <p>A more equivocal sort of dedication also prevailed. A book
    was supposed to require the prefix of some eminent name as its
    patron, in order to ensure its success. Now the author, though
    very capable of writing with propriety on his chosen theme,
    might be unequal to the courtly style which dedicators were
    wont to display, and as the <i>complement</i> was to be
    returned <i>substantially</i>, he might be tempted to employ a
    superior artist on the occasion. It was chiefly under such
    circumstances that the powers of Johnson were called into
    action. By what arguments the stern moralist would have
    endeavoured to justify the deception, for it deserves no better
    name, is more than I can undertake to decide, and I submit the
    query to his enthusiastic admirers.</p>

    <p>To the dedications enumerated by the faithful Boswell, and
    by his sharp-sighted editors, Malone and Croker, I have to
    announce on <i>internal</i> evidence, a gorgeous addition! It
    is the dedication to Edward Augustus, Duke of York, of <i>An
    Introduction to Geometry</i>, by William Payne, London: T.
    Payne, at the Mews Gate, 1767. 4&ordm;., 1768. 8&ordm;. I
    transcribe it <i>literatim</i>. It wants no comment:&mdash;</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>"TO HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS THE DUKE OF YORK.</p>

        <p>"SIR,</p>

        <p>"They who are permitted to prefix the names of princes
        to treatises of science generally enjoy the protection of a
        patron, without fearing the censure of a judge.</p>

        <p>"The honour of approaching your royal highness has given
        me many opportunities of knowing, that the work which I now
        presume to offer will not partake of the usual security.
        For as the knowledge which your royal highness has already
        acquired of GEOMETRY extends beyond the limits of an
        introduction. I expect not to inform you; I shall be happy
        if I merit your approbation.</p>

        <p>"An address to such a patron admits no recommendation of
        the science. It is superfluous to tell your royal highness
        that GEOMETRY is the primary and fundamental art of life;
        that its effects are extended through the principal
        operations of human skill; that it conducts the soldier in
        the field, and the seaman in the ocean; that it gives
        strength to the fortress, and elegance to the palace. To
        your royal highness all this is already known; GEOMETRY is
        secure of your regard, and your opinion of its usefulness
        and value has sufficiently appeared, by the condescension
        in which you have been pleased to honour
        <span class="pagenum"><a name="page260"

    the above piece to Johnson, if slight in itself, is not devoid
    of significance. He had dedicated a book for the same author,
    which book was also published by Mr. Thomas Payne, who was his
    brother, in 1756.</p>

    <h3>ST. ANTHOLIN'S.</h3>

    <p>Your correspondent MR. RIMBAULT (No. 12.) has made rather a
    grave charge against my predecessors in office as churchwardens
    and overseers of this parish; and although, I regret to say,
    such accusations of unjust stewardship and dereliction of duty
    are frequently and with justice imputed to some parish
    officers, yet I am happy to be able, in this instance, to
    remove the stigma which would otherwise attach to those of St.
    Antholin. The churchwardens' accounts are in good preservation,
    and present (in an unbroken series) the parish expenditure for
    nearly three centuries.</p>

    <p>Mr. Rimbault has doubtless been misled by some error in the
    description of the MSS. in Mr. Thorpe's catalogue (as
    advertised by him for sale), which were probably merely
    extracts from the original records.</p>

    <p>The first volume commences with the year 1574, and finishes
    in 1708; the accounts are all written at the time of their
    respective dates, and regularly signed by the auditors then and
    there present as correct.</p>

    <p>I have made numerous extracts from these interesting
    documents, and <i>notes</i> thereon, which I shall at some
    future time be happy to lay before your readers, if you should
    consider them of sufficient importance.</p>

    <p>As a voucher for what I have stated with regard to their
    existence, and to give some idea of their general character, I
    have selected (at random) a few items from the year
    1580-1:&mdash;</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>"The Accompte of Henrie Jaye, Churchwarden of the
        Parishe of St. Antholyne, from the feaste of the Anunciacon
        of our Ladye in Anno 1580 unto the same feaste followinge

    <h2>QUERIES.</h2>

    <h3>COLLEGE SALTING.</h3>

    <p>Mr. Editor.&mdash;If your very valuable work had existed in
    October, 1847, when I published in the <i>British Magazine</i>
    a part of Archibishop Whitgift's accounts relative to his
    pupils while he was Master of Trinity College, Cambridge, I
    should certainly have applied to you for assistance.</p>

    <p>In several of the accounts there is a charge for the pupil's
    "salting;" and after consulting gentlemen more accurately
    informed with regard to the customs of the university than
    myself, I was obliged to append a note to the word, when it
    occurred for the first time in the account of Lord Edward
    Zouch, in which I said, "I must confess my inability to explain
    this word; and do not know whether it may be worth while to
    state that, on my mentioning it to a gentleman, once a
    fellow-commoner of the college, he told me, that when, as a
    freshman, he was getting his gown from the maker, he made some
    remark on the long strips of sleeve by which such gowns are
    distinguished, and was told that they were called 'salt-bags,'
    but he could not learn why; and an Oxford friend tells me, that
    going to the buttery to drink salt and water was part of the
    form of his admission.... This nobleman's (<i>i.e.</i> Lord
    Edward Zouch's) amounted to 4<i>s.</i>, and that of the Earl of
    Cumberland to 3<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>, while in other cases it
    was as low as 8<i>d.</i>" To this I added the suggestion that
    it was probably some fee, or expense, which varied according to
    the rank of the parties. It afterwards occurred to me that this
    "salting" was, perhaps, some entertainment given by the
    new-comer, from and after which he ceased to be "fresh;" and
    that while we seem to have lost the "salting" both really and
    nominally, we retain the word to which it has reference.</p>

    <p>Be this as it may, my attention has just now been recalled
    to the question by my accidentally meeting with one of Owen's
    epigrams, which shows that in his time there was some sort of
    salting at Oxford, and also of peppering at Winchester. As I
    doubt not that you have readers well acquainted with the
    customs of both these seats of learning, perhaps some may be
    good enough to afford information. Owen was at Oxford not many
    years after Whitgift had been Master of Trinity at Cambridge,
    if (as Wood states) he took his bachelor's degree in 1590. The
    epigram is as follows:&mdash;</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"Oxoni&aelig; salsus (juvenis tum) more vetusto;</p>

            <p class="i2">Wintoni&aelig;que (puer tum) piperatus
            eram.</p>

            <p>Si quid inest nostro piperisve salisve libello,</p>

            <p class="i2">Oxoniense sal est, Wintoniense
            piper."</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>It is No. 64 in that book of epigrams which Owen inscribed
    "Ad Carolum Eboracensem, fratrem Principis, filium Regis," p.
    205, edit. Elz, 1628. 12mo. I give this full reference in order
    to express my most hearty sympathy with the righteous
    indignation of my highly respected friend, your correspondent
    "L.S." (No. 15 p. 230.), against imperfect references. I do
    not, however, agree with him in thinking it fortunate that he
    is not a "despotic monarch;" on the contrary, now that I have
    not to take up verses, or construe Greek to him, I should like
    it of all things; and I am sure the world would be much the

    <h3>A FEW DODO QUERIES.</h3>

    <p>The discovery and speedy extinction of that extraordinary
    bird the DODO, belongs rather to
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page262"
       id="page262"></a>{262}</span> human history than to pure
       zoology, and I therefore hope that a few Queries relating to
       this curious subject will be admissible into your
       publication. I have already, in the work entitled <i>The
       Dodo and its Kindred</i>, and in the Supplementary notices
       inserted last year in the <i>Annals and Magazine of Natural
       History</i> (ser. 2. vol. iii. pp. 136, 259; vol. iv. p.
       335), endeavoured to collect together the <i>omne scitum</i>
       of the Dodo-history, but I am satisfied that the <i>omne
       scibile</i> is not yet attained.</p>

    <p><i>Query I.</i>&mdash;Is there any historical record of the
    first discovery of Mauritius and Bourbon by the Portuguese?
    These islands bore the name of <i>Mascarenhas</i> as early as
    1598, when they were so indicated on one of the De Bry's maps.
    Subsequent compilers state that they were thus named after
    their Portuguese discoverer, but I have not succeeded in
    finding any notice of them in the histories of Portuguese
    expeditions to the East Indies which I have consulted. The only
    appartently authentic indication of their discovery, that I am
    aware of, is the pillar bearing the name of John III. of
    Portugal, and dated 1545, which is stated by Leguat, on Du
    Quesne's authority, to have been found in Bourbon by Flacour,
    when he took possession of the island in 1653.</p>

    <p><i>Query II</i>.&mdash;It appears from Leguat's <i>New
    Voyage to the East Indies</i>, London, 1708, pp. 2, 37., that
    the Marquis Du Quesne, being desirous of sending out a colony
    from Holland to the Isle of Bourbon in 1689 or 1690, published
    (probably in Dutch) an account of that Island, with a view of
    inducing emigrants to go thither. I should be greatly obliged
    if any of your readers can tell me the title, date, and place
    of publication of this book, and where a copy of it is to be
    seen or procured.</p>

    <p><i>Query III</i>.&mdash;Are there in existence any original
    oil-paintings of the Dodo by Savery or any other artist,
    besides the five described in the <i>Dodo and its
    Kindred</i>&mdash;viz., the one at the Hague, at Berlin, at
    Vienna, at the British Museum, and at Oxford? And are there any
    original engravings of this bird, besides that in De Bry, in
    Clusius, in Van den Broecke, in Herbert, in Bontekoc, and in
    Bontius, of all which I have published fac-similes?</p>

    <p><i>Query IV</i>.&mdash;Are there any <i>original</i> authors
    who mention the Dodo as a living bird, besides Van Neck,
    Clusius, Heemskerk, Willem van West-Zanen, Matelief, Van der
    Hagen, Verhuffen, Van den Broecke, Bontekoe, Herbert, Cauche,
    Lestrange, and Benjamin Harry? Or any authority for the
    <i>Solitaire</i> of Rodriguez besides Leguat and D'Heguerty; or
    for the Dodo-like birds of Bourbon besides Castelton,
    Carr&eacute; Sieur D.B., and Billiard?</p>

    <p><i>Query V</i>&mdash;In Rees' <i>Cyclop&aelig;ia</i>,
    article BOURBON, we are told that in that island there is "a
    kind of large bat, denominated <i>l'Oiseau bleu</i>, which are
    skinned and eaten as a great delicacy." Where did the compiler
    of the article pick up this statement?</p>

    <p><i>Query VI</i>.&mdash;Is there in existence any figure,
    published or unpublished, of the Dodo-like bird which once
    inhabited the Isle of Bourbon?</p>

    <p><i>Query VII</i>&mdash;What is the derivation or meaning of
    the words <i>Dodaers</i> and <i>Dronte</i>, as applied to the
    Dodo?</p>

    <p><i>Query VIII</i>.&mdash;Sir Hamon Lestrange has recorded
    that about 1638 he saw a living Dodo exhibited in London. (See
    <i>Sloane MSS</i>. 1839, v. p. 9. in Brit. Mus.; Wilkin's ed.
    of <i>Sir T. Browne's Works</i>, vol. i. p. 369.; vol. ii, p.
    173.; <i>The Dodo and its Kindred</i>, p. 22.) Is there any
    contemporary notice extant in print or in MS. which confirms
    this statement? A splendidly bound copy of <i>The Dodo and its
    Kindred</i> will be given to any one who can answer this query
    affirmatively.</p>

    <p><i>Query IX</i>.&mdash;In Holme's <i>Academy of Armory and
    Blazou</i>, Chester, 1688, p. 289, we find a Dodo figured as an
    heraldic device, a fac-simile of which is given in the
    <i>Annals of Natural History</i>, 2nd series, vol. iii. p. 260.
    The author thus describes it: "He beareth Sable a <i>Dodo</i>
    or <i>Dronte</i> proper. By the name of <i>Dronte</i>. This
    exotic bird doth equal a swan in bigness," &amp;c. &amp;c. Now
    I wish to ask, where did this family of <i>Dronte</i> reside?
    Is anything known concerning them? How did they come by these
    arms? and are any members of the family now living?</p>

    <p><i>Query X.</i>&mdash;From a passage in the <i>Histoire de
    l'Acad&eacute;mie Royale des Sciences</i>, 1776, p. 37, it
    appears that Pingr&eacute; the French astronomer, published, or
    at least wrote, a relation of his voyage to Rodriguez, in which
    he speaks of <i>Solitaires</i>. Is this the fact? and if so,
    what is the title of his work?</p>

    <h3>ON PASSAGES IN COLERIDGE'S CHRISTADEL AND BYRON'S LARA.
    TABLET TO NAPOLEON.</h3>

    <p>I am one of those who look upon the creations of our great
    poets as deserving illustration almost as much as actual
    history; and I am always distressed when I meet with passages
    representing events with respect to which I cannot make up my
    mind as to what the author meant, or intended his readers to
    believe. Two of these occur to me at this moment, and I shall
    be much obliged by any of your correspondents giving, in your
    pages, brief replies to my queries, or referring me to any
    published works where I may find their solution.</p>

    <p>1. What did Coleridge mean to represent or imply in his tale
    of <i>Christabel</i>? Who or what was Geraldine? What did
    Christabel see in her, at times, so unutterably horrible? What
    is meant by "the ladye strange" making Christabel <i>carry</i>
    her over the sill of the portal? &amp;c.,
    &amp;c.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page263"
       id="page263"></a>{263}</span>

    <p>2. What does Byron mean us to infer that Lara <i>saw</i> in
    his hall that midnight, when he so alarmed his household
    with</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"A sound, a voice, a shriek, a fearful call,</p>

            <p>A long loud shriek&mdash;and silence."?</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>The poet, it is true, seems to refuse, purposely, to let his
    readers into the truth, telling them:&mdash;</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"Whate'er his frenzy dream'd or eye beheld,</p>

            <p>If yet remember'd, ne'er to be reaveal'd,</p>

            <p>Rests at his heart."</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>But still, I conceive there can be no doubt that <i>he knew
    the truth</i> (I speak as of realities), &mdash;knew what he
    intended to represent by so full and elaborate a delineation of
    a scene. And it is the author's meaning and intention that I
    wish to come at.</p>

    <p>I will ask one more question relative to this magnificent
    poem (which I don't think has had justice done it by the
    critics), but one respecting which I hardly think there can be
    any doubt as to the author's secret meaning:&mdash;Is not the
    <i>Kaled</i> of <i>Lara</i> the <i>Gulnare</i> of the
    <i>Giaour</i>?</p>

    <p>Before concluding, I will add a query on a very different
    subject.</p>

    <p>3. Many of your readers have, doubtless, seen the large
    marble tablet erected by the Vallaisians in honour of Napoleon,
    in the Convent of the Great St. Bernard. A recent traveller in
    Switzerland (Dr. Forbes) has, I find, noticed the inscription,
    and questioned, as I had done, both its meaning and Latinity. I
    extract this author's note as expressing exactly the point on
    which I desiderate information:&mdash;</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>"Having doubts both as to the precise meaning and
        lingual purity of the compound epithet <i>Bis Italicus</i>,
        here applied to Napoleon, I subjoin the passage in which it
        occurs, for the judgement of the learned:&mdash;</p>

        <p>'NAPOLEONI ... &AElig;GYPTIACO BIS ITALICO SEMPER
        INVICTO ... GRATA RESPUBLICA.'"&mdash;<i>A Physician's
        Holiday</i>, p. 468.</p>

    <h3>MINOR QUERIES.</h3>

    <p><i>Howkey or Horkey.</i>&mdash; Can anybody explain the
    etymology of the word <i>Howkey</i> or <i>Horkey</i>, generally
    used to denote a harvest-home merriment in our eastern
    counties? Forbes speaks of it as an intractable word, and
    neither he nor Sir J. Cullum have succeeded in explaining it
    satisfactorily.</p>

    <p>Audley End, Feb. 16.</p>

    <p><i>Lord Bacon's Metrical Version of the
    Psalms.</i>&mdash;The answer in No. 15. p. 235. to A
    CORNISHMAN'S Query (No. 13. p. 202) respecting "Bacon's
    Metrical Version of the Psalms," suggests another query. The
    work in question was a mere "exercise of sickness;" it contains
    only seven psalms (the 1st, 12th, 90th, 104th, 126th, 137th,
    and 149th), and is, without pretension of any kind, a very
    proper diversion for a mind that could not be inactive and yet
    required rest; and very good verses for a man unpractised in
    metrical composition. The <i>Collection of Apophthegms</i>
    (also a recreation in sickness), though considerably larger and
    altogether weightier, was considered so trifling a work that
    Dr. Rawley, in his "perfect list of his Lordship's true works,
    &amp;c.," appended to the first edition of the
    <i>Resuscitatio</i> (1657), either forgot or did not think fit
    to mention it. Yet both these trifles were not only written but
    <i>published</i>, by Bacon himself the year before his
    death&mdash;a thing quite contrary to his practice; for though
    he had written and carefully preserved and circulated in
    manuscript so much, he had till then published nothing that was
    not of the weightiest and most solid kind. Can any of your
    correspondents inform me how much two such books may possibly
    have been <i>worth</i> to a publisher in the year 1625; being
    works of low price and popular character, proceeding from an
    author of great name? How much is it reasonable to suppose that
    a publisher may have given for the copyright? or how far may it
    have gone towards the payment of a bookseller's bill?</p>

    <p><i>Treatise of Equivocation.</i>&mdash;I shall feel happy
    if, through your very opportune medium, I can obtain some
    information respecting a very extraordinary and mysterious
    book, as to its existence, local habitation, and any other
    <i>material</i> circumstance, which has the title of <i>A
    Treatise of Equivocation.</i> The first recognition of the work
    is in the <i>Relation of the Proceedings in the Trial for the
    Powder Plot</i>, 1604. At signat. I. the Attourney-General, Sir
    E. Coke, appeals to it, and affirms that it was allowed by the
    Archpriest Blackwel, and that the title was altered to <i>A
    Treatise against Lying and Fraudulent Dissimulation</i>. He
    proceeds to describe some of its contents, as if he were
    himself acquainted with the book. Thomas Morton, Bishop of
    Lichfield, and Coventry, afterwards of Durham, in his <i>Full
    Satisfaction concerning a double Romish Iniquitie; Rebellion
    and Equivocation</i>, 1606, refers to the work as familiarly
    acquainted with it. (See Ep. Dedic. A. 3.; likewise pages 88
    &amp; 94.) He gives the authorship to Creswell or Tresham. He
    refers likewise to a Latin work entitled <i>Resolutio
    Casuum</i>, to the same effect, possibly a translation, to
    which he subjoins the names of Parsons and Allen. Robert Abbot,
    in his <i>Antilogia</i>, 1613, pp. 13, 14. emphatically and at
    length produces the same book and facts; but they are merely
    copied from the <i>Relation</i> of the Powder-treason Trial.
    Henry Mason, in his most satisfactory work, <i>The New Art of
    Lying, &amp;c.</i>, 1624, has spoken of the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page264"
       id="page264"></a>{264}</span> <i>Treatise</i> with the same
       familiarity (see p. 51.), and elsewhere, if my memory does
       not deceive me. Dodd, in his <i>Church
       history</i>,&mdash;when will the new edition begin to move
       again? Can Stonyhurst tell?&mdash;ascribes the work to
       Tresham. Hardly any of the similar works in these times
       belong to <i>one</i> author. It may just be added, that
       Parson's <i>Mitigation</i> contains, perhaps, all the
       substance of the Roman equivocation, with not much reserve
       or disguise. It was published in answer to Bishop Morton's
       work in 1607. Foulis has, of course, substantially all the
       above, but nothing more.</p>

    <p>Now, the questions which I want to have solved are
    these:&mdash;Was the book ever extant in MS. Or print? Is it
    now extant, and where? Who has seen a copy? What is its size,
    date, and extent? Has the Durham Cathedral Library, in
    particular, a copy? Mr. Botfield might have informed us. In
    fact, where is any effectual intelligence of the fugitive to be
    found?</p>

    <h2>REPLIES.</h2>

    <h3>ETYMOLOGY OF "ARMAGH."</h3>

    <p>Some of your correspondents have taken up the not unnatural
    idea, that the last syllable of the word "Armagh" is identical
    with the Celtic word <i>magh</i>, a plain. But there are two
    objections to this. In the first place, the name is never spelt
    in Irish <i>Armagh</i>, nor even <i>Ardmagh</i>, but always
    ARDMACHA. <i>Ardmagh</i> or <i>Armagh</i> is only the
    anglicised spelling, adapted to English tongues and ears. It is
    therefore clearly absurd to take this corrupt form of the word
    as our <i>datum</i>, in the attempt to search for its
    etymology. Secondly, the Irish names of places which are
    derived from, or compounded of, <i>magh</i>, a plain, are
    always anglicised, <i>moy, moi, mow</i>, or <i>mo</i>, to
    represent the pronunciation: as Fermoy, Athmoy, Knockmoy,
    Moira, Moyagher, Moyaliffe (or Me-aliffe, as it is now commonly
    spelt), Moville, Moyarta, and thousands of other cases. And
    those who are acquainted with the Irish language will at once
    tell, by the ear, that <i>Armagh</i>, as the word is pronounced
    by the native peasantry, even by those who have lost that
    language (as most of them in that district now have), could not
    be a compound of <i>magh</i>, a plain.</p>

    <p>The work of M. Bullet, quoted by your correspondent
    "HERMES," is full of ignorant blunders similar to that which he
    commits, when he tells us that Armagh in compounded of
    "<i>Ar</i>, article, and <i>mag</i>, ville." The article, in
    Irish, is <i>An</i>, not <i>ar</i>; and <i>mag</i> does not
    signify a town. He adopts, your readers will perceive, the
    modern English spelling, which could not lead to a correct
    result, even if M. Bullet had been acquainted with the Celtic
    languages. The same remark applies to the explanation given by
    the author of <i>Circles of Gomer</i>. <i>Ard</i>, not
    <i>Ar</i>, is the word to be explained; and therefore, even
    though <i>Ar</i> and <i>Ararat</i> meant, as he tells us,
    "earth, country, or upon and on the earth," this would throw no
    light on the etymology of ARD<i>macha</i>.</p>

    <p>"HIBERNICUS" (No. 14. p. 217.) is partly right and partly
    wrong; he adopts the anglicised spelling of the second
    syllable, although he seems aware that the first syllable ought
    to be <i>Ard</i>; and he admits also that this word is a
    substantive, signifying a <i>height</i>, not the adjective
    <i>high</i>. "A high plain," in Irish, would be, not Ardmagh,
    or Ardmoy (as it would have been anglicised), but
    <i>Magh-ard</i> (Anglice <i>Moyard</i>). Great light will be
    thrown on the whole subject of the etymology of Irish
    typographical names, when the Index to my friend Mr.
    O'Donovan's edition of the <i>Annals of the Four Masters</i>
    makes its appearance.</p>

    <p>I may add too, in conclusion, that Camden is wrong in
    suggesting that <i>Armach</i> (as he spells it, retaining,
    curiously enough, the correct etymology of the last syllable)
    is identical with <i>Dearmach</i> (where the last syllable
    ought to be <i>magh</i>). This latter place is the well-known
    Durrow, in the county Westmeath; and its name, in Irish, is
    <i>Duir-magh</i>, which is really a compound from <i>magh</i>,
    a plain. Bede tells us, that the word signified, in the
    Scottish language, <i>Campus roborum</i> (see Bede, <i>Hist.
    Eccl.</i> lib. iii. c. 4.); but Adamson (<i>Vit.
    Columb&aelig;</i>, c. 39.) more correctly translates it,
    "monasterium <i>Roboreti Campi</i>." It is not likely that such
    authorities could confound Durrow, in Westmeath, with the
    ecclesiastical metropolis of Ireland, and patriarchal see of
    St. Patrick.</p>

    <p>Whoever the Mach or Macha was from whom Ardmacha has its
    name (whether the queen called Macha-mong-ruadh, whose reign is
    assigned by O'Flaherty to A.M. 3603, or the older Macha, who is
    said to be the wife of Nemedius), it should be borne in mind,
    that the word whose etymology is required is
    ARDMACHA<a id="footnotetag16"
       name="footnotetag16"></a><a href="#footnote16"><sup>16</sup></a>,
       and not <i>Armagh.</i> What would be thought of the critic
       who would now attempt to investigate the etymology of the
       English word <i>bishop</i>, by dividing it into two
       syllables, and seeking analogies in sound for each
       syllable.</p>

    <p>I have ventured to go at greater length into this matter
    than its importance may seem to warrant, because it illustrates
    so clearly a very general error, from which Celtic literature
    has deeply suffered, of inventing fanciful etymologies adapted
    to the modern English spellings, instead of the original Celtic
    forms of names; and this error, as the question before us
    proves, is as old as Camden's time, and older.</p>

    <h3>WILLIAM BASSE AND HIS POEMS.</h3>

    <p>I read with great pleasure MR. COLLIER'S interesting paper
    on "William Basse and his Poems," inserted in your 13th Number.
    Very little is known of this once popular poet, but it is very
    desirable that that little should be collected together, which
    cannot be better effected than through the friendly system of
    inter-communication established by your valuable journal.</p>

    <p>From my limited researches upon this subject, it appears
    that there were two poets of the name of William Basse. Anthony
    Wood (<i>Athen. Oxon.</i>, edit. Bliss. iv. 222.) speaks of one
    William Basse, of Moreton, near Thame, in Oxfordshire, who was
    some time a retainer of Lord Wenman, of Thame Park, <i>i.e.</i>
    Richard Viscount Wenman, in the peerage of Ireland. And I find
    among my MS. biographical collections that a William Basse, of
    Suffolk, was admitted a sizar of Emanuel College, Cambridge, in
    1629. A.B. 1632, and A.M. in 1636. The William Basse who wrote
    <i>Great Brittaines Sunnes-set</i> in 1613, was also the author
    of the MS. collection of poems entitled <i>Polyhymnia</i>,
    mentioned by MR. COLLIER. In proof of this it is merely
    necessary to notice the dedication of the former "To his
    Honourable Master, Sir Richard Wenman, Knight," and the verses
    and acrostics in the MS. "To the Right Hon. the Lady Aungier
    Wenman, Mrs. Jane Wenman, and the truly noble, vertuous, and
    learned Lady, the Lady Agnes Wenman." Basse's Poems were
    evidently intended for the press, but we may conjecture that
    the confusion of the times prevented them from appearing.
    Thomas Warton, in his <i>Life and Literary Remains of Ralph
    Bathurst, M.D.</i>, has a copy of verses by the Dr. "To Mr. W.
    Basse, upon the intended publication of his Poems, January 13,
    1651;" to which the learned editor adds, "I find no account of
    this writer or his poems." The whole consists of forty-four
    verses, from which I extract the beginning and the
    end:&mdash;</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>Basse, whose rich mine of wit we here behold</p>

            <p>As porcelain earth, more precious, 'cause more

            <p>Who, like an aged oak, so long hath stood,</p>

            <p>And art religion now as well as food:</p>

            <p>And our deceased grandsires lisp'd thy rhymes;</p>

            <p>Yet we can sing thee too, and make the lays</p>

            <p>Which deck thy brow look fresher with thy
            praise.</p>
            <hr />

            <p>Though these, your happy births, have silent
            past</p>

            <p>More years than some abortive wits shall last;</p>

            <p>He still writes new, who once so well hath sung:</p>

            <p>That Muse can ne'er be old, which ne'er was
            young."</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>These verses are valuable as showing that Basse was living
    in 1651, and that he was then an aged man. The Emanuelian of
    the same name, who took his M.A. degree in 1636, might possibly
    be his son. At any rate, the latter was a poet. There are some
    of his pieces among the MSS. in the Public Library, Cambridge;
    and I have a small MS. volume of his rhymes, scarcely soaring
    above mediocrity, which was presented to me by an ancient
    family residing in Suffolk.</p>

    <p>A poem by William Basse is inserted in the <i>Annalia
    Dubrensia</i>, 1636, in praise of Robert Dover and his revival
    of the Cotswold Games; but it is not clear to which of these
    poets we may ascribe it. Malone attributes two rare volumes to
    one or other of these poets. The first, a translation or
    paraphrase of Juvenal's tenth satire, entitled <i>That which
    seems Best is Worst</i>, 12mo., 1617; the second, "A Miscellany
    of Merriment," entitled <i>A Helpe to Discourse</i>, 2nd edit.
    8vo., 1620: but the former is more probably the work of William
    Barkstead. I may mention that a copy of Basse's <i>Sword and
    Buckler, or Serving Man's Defence</i>, 1602, is among Malone's
    books in the Bodleian.</p>

    <p>Izaac Walton speaks of William Basse, "one that hath made
    the choice songs of the <i>Hunter in His Career</i>, and of
    <i>Tom of Bedlam</i>, and many others of note." The ballad
    mentioned by MR. COLLIER, "Maister Basse his Career, or the
    Hunting of the Hare," is undoubtably the one alluded to by
    Walton. I may add, that it is printed in <i>Wit and
    Drollery</i>, edit. 1682. p. 64.; and also in <i>Old
    Ballads</i>, 1725, vol. iii. p. 196. The tune is contained in
    the <i>Shene MS.</i>, a curious collection of old tunes in the
    Advocate's Library, Edinburgh; and a ballad entitled
    <i>Hubert's Ghost</i>, to the tune of <i>Basse's Carrier</i>,
    is preserved among the Bagford Collection of Old Ballads in the
    British Museum. With regard to the second ballad mentioned by
    Walton, our knowledge is not so perfect. Sir John Hawkins in a
    note (<i>Complete Angler</i>, 5th edit. p. 73.)
    says:&mdash;</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"This song, beginning&mdash;</p>

            <p class="i2">'Forth from my dark and dismal cell,'</p>

    </div>

    <blockquote>
        <p>with the music to it, set by Hen. Lawes, is printed in a
        book, entitled <i>Choice Ayres, Songs and Dialogues, to
        sing to the Theorbo Lute, and Bass Viol</i>, folio. 1675,
        and in Playfield's <i>Antidote against Melancholy</i>, 8vo.
        1669, and also in Dr. Percy's <i>Reliques of Ancient
        English Poetry</i>, vol. ii. p. 350; but in the latter with
        a mistake in the last line of the third stanza, of the word
        <i>Pentarchy</i> for <i>Pentateuch</i>."</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>A copy of the <i>Choice Ayres</i>, 1675, is now before me,
    but Henry Lawes's name does not appear to the song in question.
    Sir John has evidently made a mistake; the air of <i>Mad
    Tom</i> was composed by John Cooper, alias <i>Giovanni
    Coperario</i>, for one of the Masques perfomed by the Gentlemen
    of Gray's Inn. (See <i>The English Dancing Master</i>, 1651, in
    the British Museum, and Additional MS. 10,440, in the same
    repository.) With regard to the ballad itself, there is an
    early copy (of the latter part of the sixteenth century)
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page266"
       id="page266"></a>{266}</span> preserved in the Harleian
       MSS., No. 7332, fol. 41. It purports to have been</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>"Written (i.e. transcribed) be Feargod Barebone, who
        being at many times idle and wanting employment, wrote out
        certain songs and epigrams, with the idea of mending his
        hand in writing."</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>There is another copy among Malone's MSS. in the Bodleian
    (No. 16. p. 55.), where it is entitled <i>A new Tom of
    Bedlam</i>. But I contend there is no evidence to show that
    this is the ballad alluded to by Walton; none of the copies
    having the name of the author. We have two other songs
    (probably more) bearing the same title of <i>Tom of Bedlam</i>;
    one beginning, "From the top of high Caucasus;" the other
    commencing, "From the hag and hungry goblin;" either of which
    are quite as likely to have been intended as that mentioned
    above.</p>

    <p>It still remains a question, I think, which of the two
    Basses was the author of the ballads mentioned by Walton. But I
    have already trespassed so long upon your valuable space that I
    will leave the further consideration of the subject until a
    future period: in the meantime, perhaps some of your
    correspondents may be enabled to "illuminate our darkness" upon
    the various knotty points.</p>

    <h3>BEAVER HATS&mdash;PISAN.</h3>

    <p>Allow me to say a few words in reply to your correspondent
    "GASTROS." His quotation from Fairholt (<i>Costume in
    England</i>), who cites Stubbes's <i>Anatomy of Abuses</i> as
    the earliest authority for the use of beaver hats in England,
    is not a satisfactory reply to my query; inasmuch as I am aware
    that beaver hats were occasionally worn by great people in this
    country some centuries before Stubbes was born. For example,
    Henry III. possessed "unum capellum de Bevre cum apparatu auri
    et lapidibus preciosis;" as appears from the "Wardrobe
    Account," of the 55th year of his reign. I have, therefore,
    still to ask for the <i>earliest</i> instance of the use of
    hats or caps of this material in England; such hats, as well as
    gloves, are mentioned in several English inventories made
    between the thirteenth and sixteenth centuries. Is there any
    example earlier than the time of Henry III.?</p>

    <p>"GASTROS" has also obligingly replied to my query as to "the
    meaning of the term <i>Pisan</i>, used in old records for some
    part of defensive armour," but he seems to have forgotten that
    I expressly stated that term had no relation to "the fabrics of
    Pisa;" at least such is my belief. With regard to the inventory
    of the arms and armour of Louis le Hutin, taken in 1316,
    printed in Meyrick's <i>Ancient Armour</i>, to which he kindly
    refers me, it may be observed that the said inventory is so
    perversely translated in the first edition of that work (just
    now I have no means of consulting the second), as to be all but
    useless; indeed it might be termed one of the most
    extraordinary literary performances of modern times, as the
    following instance may suffice to show. One of the items of the
    inventory is, "une cote gambois&eacute;e &agrave; arbroissiaus
    d'or broud&eacute;es &agrave; chardonereus;" and it is thus
    rendered into English, "a gamboised coat with a rough surface
    (like a thicket;&mdash;<i>note</i>) of gold embroidered on the
    nap of the cloth!" The real signification is "a gamboised coat
    embroidered in gold, with little bushes (or trees), with
    gold-finches [on them]." But I am rather wandering from my
    point: I never could ascertain on what authority Sir Samuel
    Meyrick asserted that "jazeran armour," as he calls it, was
    formed of "overlapping plates." The French word <i>jazeran</i>
    was derived from the Italian <i>ghiazarino</i>, or
    <i>ghiazzerino</i>, which signified "a gorget of mail," or what
    some of our antiquaries have termed "a standard of mail;" in
    France this word always preserved its relation to mail, and in
    process of time came to be applied to so lowly an object as a
    flagon-chain: see Cotgrave's <i>Fr. Dict.</i> ed. 1673.
    Roquefort, indeed, says a "jaserans" was a cuirass, but to my
    apprehension the passage which he quotes from the <i>Roman
    d'Alexandre</i>&mdash;</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"Es haubers, <i>jazerans</i>, et &egrave;s elmes
            gemez"&mdash;</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>seems to prove that, in that instance at least, a gorget is
    meant. At any rate, the translation of the passage in the
    inventory to which "GASTROS" refers should be, "three Pisan
    collerets of steel mail," not that given by Meyrick. Here we
    have clearly a fabric of Pisa: whereas the <i>pisan</i>, of
    which I desire to know the meaning, invariable occurs as an
    independent term, e.g. "<i>item, unum pisanum</i>," or "<i>unum
    par pisanorum</i>." Of course I have my own conjecture on the
    subject, but should be glad to hear other opinions; so I again
    put the question to your correspondents. In conclusion I would
    observe to "GASTROS" that they must be <i>very</i> late MSS.
    indeed in which such a contraction as <i>pisan</i> for
    <i>partisan</i> can be found. If you have room, and think it
    worth while, I will from time to time send you some corrections
    of the more flagrant errors of Meyrick.</p>

    "B.'s" inquiries, he will find much information in the
    Publications de la Soci&eacute;t&eacute; des Antiquaires de
    Normandie. Under their auspices, M. Estancelin published in
    1828 a full history of the Earls of Eu. I am not aware of any
    full collection of pedigrees of the companions of William the
    Conqueror: the names of several of the lands from which they
    took their designations yet remain.</p>

    <p><i>Norman Pedigrees.</i>&mdash;In answer to "B.'s" query

    Paris, 1831, entitled <i>Dictionnaire Complet
    G&eacute;ographique, Statistique, et Commercial de la France et
    de ses Colonies; par M. Briand-de-Verz&eacute;</i>, pp. 856.
    Many of the names of the Conqueror's Norman companions will be
    found in that work; as, for instance, Geoffrey de
    "<i>Mandeville</i>, village. Calvados arrondissement,
    31&frac12; O.N.O. de Bayeaux," &amp;c.</p>

    <p>Norman de <i>Beauchamp</i>: three Beauchamps are mentioned;
    that 51. from Avranches will be the one in question.</p>

    <p><i>Norman Pedigrees.</i>&mdash;Your correspondent "B." (No.
    14. p. 214.) would probably find part of the information he
    seeks in <i>Domesday Book, seu Censualis Willelmi Primi Regis
    Angli&aelig;</i>. But query? Is "B." right in supposing the
    prefix "De" to be <i>French</i>? Does it not rather originate
    in the <i>Latin</i>?</p>

    <p>"Domesday" is written in Latin throughout; and the "de,"
    denoting the place, is there occasionally followed by what
    seems to be the Latin ablative case. I copy an
    example:&mdash;</p>

    <p><i>Ave Trici and Gheeze Ysenoudi.</i>&mdash;I regret that I
    cannot give "H.L.B." any further information about these ladies
    than the colophon I transcribed affords. To me, however, it is
    quite clear that they were sisters of some convent in Flanders
    or Holland; the name of their spiritual father, Nicolas Wyt,
    and the names of the ladies, clearly indicate this.</p>

    <p class="author">S.W.S.</p>

    <p><i>Daysman</i> (No. 12. p. 188.)&mdash; It seems to me that
    a preferable etymology may be found to that given by Nares and
    Jacob. The arbiter or judge might formerly have occupied a
    <i>dais</i> or <i>lit de justice</i>, or he might have been
    selected from those entitled to sit on the raised parts of the
    courts of law, <i>i.e.</i> jurisconsulti, or barristers as we
    call them. I have heard another etymology, which however I do
    not favour, that the arbiter, chosen from men of the same rank
    as the disputants, should be paid for loss of his day's
    work.</p>

    <p class="author">GEORGE OLIVER.</p>

    <p>Perhaps the following may be of some use in clearing up this
    point. In the <i>Graphic Illustrator</i>, a literary and
    antiquarian miscellany edited by E.W. Brayley, London, 1834, at
    p. 14, towards the end of an article on the Tudor Style of
    Architecture, signed T.M. is the following:&mdash;</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>"This room (talking of the great halls in old
        manor-houses) was in every manor-house a necessary
        appendage for holding 'the court,' the services belonging
        to which are equally denominated 'the homage,' with those
        of the king's palace. The <i>dais</i>, or raised part of
        the <i>upper end</i> of the hall, <i>was so called</i>,
        from the administration of justice. A <i>dais-man</i> is
        still a popular term for an arbitrator in the North, and
        <i>Domesday-Book</i> (with the name of which I suppose
        every one to be familiar) is known to be a list of

    should apply the rents and profits of the same in providing so

    <p><i>Derivation of "Calamity"</i> (No. 14. p.
    215.)&mdash;"Calamity" is from the Latin <i>calamitas</i>, from
    <i>calamus</i> a straw or stalk of corn, signifying, 1st, the
    agricultural misfortune of the corn being beaten down or laid
    by a storm; and thence, any other trouble or
    disaster:&mdash;</p>

    <p>"Ipsa egreditur nostri fundi <i>calamitas</i>."</p>

    <p>Ter. <i>Eun</i>. i. 1.</p>

    <p>Upon which the commentator in the Delph. ed. has this
    note:&mdash;</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>"<i>Calamitas</i> est grando et tempestas, qu&aelig;
        calamos segetum prosternit et conterit. Unde Cicero Verrem
        vocat '<i>calamitosam tempestatem</i>.'"</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Ainsworth, quoting the above passage from Terence,
    adds:&mdash;</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>"Ubi Donatus. Proprie <i>calamitatem</i> rustici vocant
        quod comminuat <i>calamum</i>; h.e. culmen et segetem."</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>The etymology of its synonym, "<i>disaster</i>," is more
    direct&mdash;&delta;&upsilon;&sigma;
    &alpha;&sigma;&tau;&eta;&rho;, a star of evil influence, or, as
    we say, "born under an ill planet."</p>

    <p class="author">
    &Phi;&iota;&lambda;&omicron;&lambda;&omicron;&gamma;&omicron;&sigma;.</p>

    <p>Forcellini, <i>s.v. Calamitas</i>, says:&mdash;</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>"Proprie significat imminutionem clademque calamorum
        segetis, qu&aelig; grandine vel impetuoso aliquo turbine
        aut alia quapiam de causa fit."</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>He then quotes Servius, <i>Ad Georg</i>, i. 151:&mdash;</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>"Robigo genus est vitii, quo culmi pereunt, quod a
        rusticanis calamitas dicitur."</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Then follows the note of Donatus on Ter. <i>Eun</i>. i. 1.
    34.</p>

    <p>It appears to me, if "<i>calamitas</i>" were derived from
    <i>calamus</i>, it would mean something very different from
    what it does.</p>

    <p>Another suggestion is, that the first syllable is the same
    as the root of <i>cad-o</i>, to fall; <i>l</i> and <i>d</i>,
    everybody knows, are easily interchangeable: as Odysseus,
    Ulixes: &delta;&alpha;&kappa;&rho;&upsilon;&omicron;&nu;,
    <i>lacrima</i>, <i>tear</i>, &amp;c. &amp;c. If so,
    <i>calamitas</i> is a corrupted form of <i>cadamitas</i>. Mar.
    Victorinus, <i>De Orthogr</i>. p. 2456., says:&mdash;</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>"Gueius Pompeius Magnus et scribebat et dicebat

        vol. v. p. 21.)</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>But how is the -<i>amitas</i> to be explained? I may as well
    add, that D&ouml;derlein, with his usual felicity, derives it
    from &kappa;&omicron;&lambda;&omicron;&upsilon;&omega;.</p>

    <p class="author">EDWARD S. JACKSON.</p>

    <p>I beg to refer MR. F.S. MARTIN (No. 14. p. 215.), for the
    derivation of "Calamity," to the <i>Etymologicon Lingu&aelig;
    Latin&aelig;</i> of Gerard Vossius, or to the <i>Totius
    Latinitatis Lexicon</i> of Facciolatus and Forcellinus. He will
    there find that the word <i>calamitas</i> was first used with
    reference to the storms which destroyed the stalks
    (<i>calami</i>) of corn, and afterwards came to signify
    metaphorically, any severe misfortune. The terrific hail-storm
    of the summer of 1843, which destroyed the crops of corn
    through several of the eastern and midland counties of this
    kingdom, was a <i>calamity</i> in the original sense of the
    word.</p>

    <p>"W.P.P." has also kindly replied to this query by furnishing
    a part of the Article on <i>Calamitas</i> in Vossius; and
    "J.F.M." adds, <i>Calamitas</i> means&mdash;</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>"The spindling of the corn, which with us is rare, but

    <p><i>Derivation of "Zero"</i> (No. 14. p.

    <i>avere nel zero, m&eacute;priser souverainement</i>, to value
    at nothing, to have a sovereign contempt for. I do not know
    what the etymology of the word may be; but the application is
    obvious to that point in the scale of the thermometer below the

    <p>"<i>Zero</i>" (No. 14. p. 215.)&mdash;<i>Zero</i>, as is
    well known, is an Italian word signifying the arithmetical
    figure of nought (0). It has been conjectured that it is
    derived from the transposition from the Hebrew word
    <i>ezor</i>, a girdle, the zero assuming that form. (See
    Fureti&egrave;re, vol. iii.) Prof. le Moine, of Leyden (quoted
    by M&eacute;nage), claims for it also an Eastern origin, and
    thinks we have received it from the Arabians, together with
    their method of reckoning ciphers. He suggests that it may be a
    corruption from the Hebrew [Hebrew: rphs], <i>safara</i>, to
    number.</p>

    <p><i>Complutensian Polyglot</i>.&mdash;I cannot pretend to

    he not have seen the pamphlet, to refer to Bishop Smallridge's
    "Enquiry into the Authority of the Primitive Complutensian
    Edition of the New Testament, as principally founded on the
    most ancient Vatican MS., together with some research after
    that MS. In order to decide the dispute about 1 John v. 7. In a

    <p><i>Sir William Rider</i>.&mdash;In reply to the queries of

       with additions.</p>

    <blockquote>

    <p><i>Pokership</i> (No. 12. p. 185., and No. 14. p.
    218.).&mdash;It is to be regretted that no information has been
    supplied respecting the meaning of this remarkable word, either
    from local sources or from the surveys of crown lands in the
    Exchequer or Land Revenue offices. In one or the other of these
    quarters we should surely find something which would dispense
    with further conjecture. In the meantime the following facts,
    obtained from records easily accessible, will probably be
    sufficient to dispose of the explanations hitherto suggested,
    and to show that the <i>poker</i> of Bringwood forest was
    neither a <i>parker</i> nor a <i>purser</i>.</p>

    <p>The offices conveyed to Sir R. Harley by James I. had been,
    before his reign, the subject of crown grants, after the honor
    of Wigmore had become vested in the crown by the merger of the
    earldom of March in the crown. Hence, I find that in the act 13
    Edward IV. (A.D. 1473), for the resumption of royal grants,
    there is a saving of a prior grant of the "office of keeper of
    oure forest or chace of Boryngwode," and of the fees for the
    "kepyng of the Dikes within oure counte of Hereford, parcelles
    of oure seid forest." (6 <i>Rot. Parl.</i> p. 94.)</p>

    <p>In a similar act of resumption, 1 Henry VII., there is a
    like saving in favour of Thomas Grove, to whom had been granted
    the keepership of Boryngwood chase in "Wigmoresland," and "the
    <i>pokershipp</i> and keping of the diche of the same." The
    <i>parkership</i> of Wigmore Park is saved in the same act. (6
    <i>Rot. Parl.</i> p. 353 and 383.)</p>

    <p>In the first year of Henry VIII. there is a Receiver's
    Account of Wigmore, in which I observe the following deductions
    claimed in respect of the fees and salaries of officers:-</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"In feodo Thom&aelig; Grove, forestarii de
            Bringewod,</p>

            <p class="i10">6<i>l.</i> 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i></p>

            <p class="i4">&mdash; ejusdem Thom&aelig;, fossat'de
            Prestwode dych,</p>

            <p class="i4">&mdash; Edm. Sharp, parcarii parci de
            Wiggemour,</p>

            <p class="i10">6<i>l.</i> 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i></p>

            <p class="i4">&mdash; Thom&aelig; Grove, pocar' omnium
            boscorum</p>

            <p class="i10">in Wiggemourslonde - 30<i>s.</i>
            4<i>d.</i>"</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>There is another like account rendered in 23 &amp; 24 Hen.
    VII. These, and no doubt many other accounts and documents
    respecting the honor of Wigmore and its appartenances, are
    among the Exchequer records, and we are entitled to infer from
    them, firstly, that a <i>parcarius</i> and a <i>pocarius</i>
    are two different offices; secondly, that, whether the duty of
    the latter was performed on the dikes or in the woods of
    Boringwood chase, the theory of Mr. Bolton Corney (pace cl.
    viri dixerim) is very deficient in probability. If the above
    authorities had not fallen under my notice, I should have
    confidently adopted the conjecture of the noble Querist, who
    first drew attention to the word, and, so far from considering
    the substitution of "poker" for "parker" an improbable blunder
    of the copyist, I should have pronounced it fortunate for the
    house of Harley that their founder had not been converted into
    a porcarius or pig-driver.</p>

    <p class="author">E. SMIRKE.</p>

    <p><i>Pokership</i>.&mdash;I had flattered myself that
    <i>Parkership</i> was the real interpretation of the above
    word, but I have once more doubts on the subject. I this
    morning accidentally stumbled upon the word "Porcellagium,"
    which is interpreted in Ducange's <i>Glossary</i>, "Tributum ex
    porcis seu porcellis."</p>

    <p><i>Porcarius</i> also occurs as <i>Porcorum custos</i>, and
    mention is made of "Porcorum servitium quo quis porcos domini
    sui pascentes servare tenetur."</p>

    <p>Now, considering how much value was formerly attached to the
    right of turning out swine in wooded wastes, during the acorn
    season, it seems probable that Sir R. Harley might be the
    king's "Porcarius," or receiver of the money paid for an annual
    license to depasture hogs in the royal forests; and, after all,
    <i>Porkership</i> is as like to <i>Pokership</i> as
    <i>Parkership</i>, and one mistake would be as easily made as
    the other.</p>

    <p class="author">BRAYBROOKE.</p>

    <p>Audley End, Feb. 16.</p>

    <p class="note">[We are enabled to confirm the accuracy of Lord
    Braybrooke's conjecture as to <i>Pokership</i> being the office
    conferred upon Sir Robert Harley, inasmuch as we are in
    expectation of receiving an account of the various forms of its
    name from a gentleman who has not only the ability, but also
    peculiar facilities for illustrating this and similar obscure
    terms.]</p>

    <p><i>Havior&mdash;Heavier or Hever</i>.-Supposed etymology of
    <i>Havior, Heavier</i>, and <i>Hever</i>, as applied by
    park-keepers to an emasculated male deer.&mdash;"NOTES AND
    QUERIES," (No. 15. p. 230.)</p>

    <p>Pennant, in his <i>British Zoology</i>, 8vo. edition, 1776,
    vol. i. p. 38., and 8vo. edition, 1812, vol. i. p. 45., under
    the article, "Goat" says:&mdash;</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>"The meat of a castrated goat of six or seven years old,
        (which is called <i>Hyfr</i>,) is reckoned the best; being
        generally very sweet and fat. This makes an excellent
        pasty, goes under the name of rock venison, and is little
        inferior to that of the deer."</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>As Pennant was a Welchman, a scholar and a
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page270"
       id="page270"></a>{270}</span> naturalist, he will probably
       be considered good authority; and <i>Hyfr</i>, the most
       likely origin of the altered terms of the deer
       park-keepers.</p>

    <p>The word occurs twice in page 61. vol. ii. of the
    <i>Sportsman's Cabinet</i>, in the article on the Stag or Red
    Deer, where it is printed <i>Heavier</i>; and it will be found
    also as <i>Hever</i>, in Mr. Jesse's <i>Scenes and Tales of
    Country Life</i>, at page 349.</p>

    <p class="author">WM. YARRELL.</p>

    <p>Ryder Street, St. James, Feb. 11. 1850.</p>

    <p>Mr. Halliwell gives the words <i>haver</i> and
    <i>havering</i>, in the same sense as <i>havior</i>. Are not
    these words identical with <i>aver, averium</i>, in the sense
    of cattle, tame beasts? <i>Averium</i>, from the old French,
    <i>aveir</i>, i.e. <i>avoir</i>, originally meant any personal
    property; but like <i>catalla</i>, chattels, it came to signify
    more particularly the most important part of a peasant's
    possessions&mdash;namely, his live stock. Thus, in the laws of
    William the Conqueror (Thorpe's <i>Ancient Laws</i>, vol. ii.
    p. 469.), we find:&mdash;</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>"Si pr&aelig;positus hundredi equos aut boves aut oves
        aut porcos vel cujuscumque generis averia vagancia restare
        fecerit," &amp;c.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>The word may naturally enough have been applied to deer
    reduced to the state of tame and domesticated cattle.</p>

    <p class="author">C.W.G.</p>

    <p class="note">[TREBOR furnishes us with a reference to
    <i>Pegge's Anonymiana</i>, who endeavours to show that the
    proper term is "halfer;" on the same principle that an entire
    horse is spoken of, the word being pronounced "h&acirc;ver" by
    those who call half "h&acirc;fe," while those who pronounce
    half with the open <i>a</i> say "hauver:" while J. Westby
    Gibson suggests that Havior is <i>Evir</i>, from the Latin
    "<i>Eviro, Eviratus, Eviratio</i>," but admits that he can give
    no authority for the use of <i>Evir</i>.]</p>

    <p><i>Sir W. Hamilton</i> (No. 14. p. 216.).&mdash;Douglas
    says, that this Sir W. Hamilton was not <i>son</i>, but
    grandson and brother of the 1st and 2nd earls of Abercorn, his
    father having died <i>vit&acirc; patris</i>. I therefore doubt
    that the inscription has been miscopied. "He was," Douglas
    says, "resident at Rome, on the part of the Queen Dowager;" but
    this could hardly be the service alluded to.</p>

        each Day at 12 o'Clock. Catalogues may be had as

    <p>It is a Catalogue of 28 pages and 662 lots, of which 650 are
    books. The twelve last are prints, chiefly "framed and glazed."
    The Catalogue is very rare; there is not a copy in the British
    Museum, and Messrs. Christie and Manson are without one. I may
    add, as your correspondent is curious about Johnson's Library,
    that I have the presentation copy to the Doctor of Twiss's
    <i>Travels in Spain</i>, with "the gift of the Author" in
    Johnson's handwriting, immediately beneath Twiss's MS.

    <h2>MISCELLANIES.</h2>

    <p><i>Etymology of "News</i>."&mdash;The word "news" is not
    derived, as many suppose, from the adjective new, but from a
    practice that obtained in newspapers of an early date, of
    prefixing to the title the letters expressive of the cardinal
    points, thus:&mdash;</p>

    <table summary="NEWS"
           align="center">
        <tr>
            <td></td>

    <p>Messrs. Sotheby and Co. will sell on Monday next two
    collections of Autographs; the first consisting of Autograph
    Letters, the property of a gentleman; which will be immediately
    followed by that belonging to the late Mr. Rodd, and the
    extensive Correspondence of the late William Upcott, Esq.,
    comprising several thousand Autograph Letters. Mr. Rodd's
    collection comprises many letters of great historical and
    literary interest.</p>

    <p>Messrs. Puttick and Simpson will sell by auction on Friday,
    March the 8th, and seven following days, the extensive and very
    important Stock of Books of Mr. James Carpenter, of Bond
    Street, who is retiring from business. The characteristics of
    this fine collection are the numerous books of prints and
    illustrated works which it contains, such as the matchless
    Series of Piranesi's Works, being the dedication copy to the
    king of Sweden: a copy of Boswell's <i>Life of Johnson</i>, in
    8 vols. <span class="pagenum"><a name="page271"

       six hundred Portraits and Views.</p>

    <p>We heard some time since that the long-established and
    highly-respectable house of Payne and Foss, of Pall Mall, had
    succeeded the late Mr. Rodd in the agency of purchasing for the
    British Museum. The rumour proved to be unfounded, and now
    receives a formal contradiction by the announcement that
    Messrs. Payne and Foss are retiring from business, and that the
    first portion of their extensive and valuable Stock of Books
    will be sold by auction by Messrs. Sotheby and Co.; the first
    division in a ten days' sale, commencing on the 18th and
    terminating on the 28th March; which will be followed by the
    second division, which will also occupy ten days, and commence
    on Monday the 8th April. The lovers of choice copies of fine
    editions of first-class books will have, on this occasion, such
    an opportunity of enriching their collections as rarely
    presents itself.</p>

    <p>We have received the following Catalogues:&mdash;</p>

    <p>THE PRIM&AElig;VAL ANTIQUITIES OF DENMARK. By J.J.A.
    WORSAAE, M.R.S.A., of Copenhagen. Translated and applied to the
    Illustration of similar Remains in England, by WILLIAM J.
    THOMS, ESQ., F.S.A., Secretary of the Camden Society.

    <blockquote>
        <p>"This is the best antiquarian handbook we have ever met
        with&mdash;so clear is its arrangement, and so well and so
        plainly is each subject illustrated by well-executed
        engravings, that confusion for the future is impossible
        upon a variety of points on which the most grievous
        mistakes have hitherto been made by anxious and zealous
        antiquarians. * * * It is the joint production of two men
        who have already distinguished themselves as authors and
        antiquarians. It is a book of which it may be said, that in
        every sentence is to be found an interesting fact, and that
        every page teems with instruction, and may be regarded as a
        sure guide to all antiquarians in their future
        arch&aelig;ological inquiries."&mdash;<i>Morning

    <p>THE JUDGES OF ENGLAND; from the TIME of the CONQUEST. By
    EDWARD FOSS, F.S.A.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>"A work in which a subject of great historical
        importance is treated with the care, diligence, and
        learning it deserves; in which Mr. Foss has brought to
        light many points previously unknown, corrected many
        errors, and shown such ample knowledge of his subject as to
        conduct it successfully through all the intricacies of a
        difficult investigation, and such taste and judgment as
        will enable him to quit, when occasion requires, the dry
        details of a professional inquiry, and to impart to his
        work, as he proceeds, the grace and dignity of a
        philosophical history."&mdash;<i>Gent. Mag.</i></p>

        <p>"The production of an English clergyman, and bears
        unequivocal marks of refined taste, elegant scholarship,
        and a liberal, generous, and candid mind. The idea&mdash;to
        us a novel one&mdash;carried out in this work is, to bring
        up for judgment (as the Egyptians used to do with their
        departed kings) the characters that figure most in the page
        of history, and to pass sentence upon them. Summoning them,
        as it were, into his presence with the lamp of history to
        guide him, <i>exquiritque auditque dolos</i>; and whether
        it be praise or blame, or a mixture of both, that he
        awards, the judgment is pronounced in a temperate spirit,
        and with judicial impartiality; and it is expressed in pure
        and elegant Latin, and often with epigrammatic
        felicity."&mdash;<i>Scotsman</i>.</p>

        point through the shadow of the tomb to the brightness and
        light beyond it. His work is, in truth, a treasury of

        <p>It appears from an entry in the preceding year, that
        this man was first sent to "Sentt Thomas Spittell in
        Soughwork," when it was discovered that he was afflicted
        with the leprosy, or some cutaneous disease, and
        immediately removed to the Lazar-house at Mile End, it
        being strictly forbidden that such cases should remain in
        the hospitals. These lazar-houses were built away from the
        town; one was the Lock Hospital, in Southwark; one at
        Kingsland, another at Knightsbridge, and that mentioned
        above between Mile End and Stratford. The laws were very
        strict in the expulsion of leprous people from the city;
        and if they attempted to force their way into the
        hospitals, they were bound fast to horses, and dragged away
        to the lazar-houses.</p>

terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1

Gutenberg-tm License.

     License.  You must require such a user to return or

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can

written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year. For example:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
     http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
